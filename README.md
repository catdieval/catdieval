## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Catherine Dieval. 
I am French and live in Germany, between Frankfurt am Main and WÃ¼rzburg. 
I have studied physics and worked in different countries as a space physicist. ðŸ”­

In that period I was doing scientific data analysis from measuring instruments onboard spacecrafts orbiting Mars, by programming in the languages Matlab / IDL. 
I realized back then that writing code was for me an exciting part of that work.

Later I decided to change career and realized that I wanted to code for a living. 
In 2023 I discovered a new passion for web development and took a dedicated course with the company neue fische. 
I am now specialized in frontend with HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React, and can do basic backend with Next.js / Node.js.

I am excited to start a new  career as a frontend / fullstack web developer! ðŸ’¯

You can find my web development portfolio in the Repositories tab.
