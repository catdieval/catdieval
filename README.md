## Hi there 👋

My name is Catherine Dieval. 
I am French and live in Germany, between Frankfurt am Main and Würzburg. 
I have studied physics (Bachelor in physics, Master in astrophysics and PhD in space technology) and worked at universities and institutes in different countries (Sweden, USA, UK and Germany) as a space physicist. 🔭

In that period I was doing scientific data analysis from measuring instruments onboard spacecrafts orbiting Mars, by programming in the languages Matlab and IDL. 
I realized back then that writing code was for me an exciting part of that work.

Later I decided to change career and realized that I wanted to code for a living. 
In 2023 I discovered a new passion for web development and took a dedicated course with the company [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/en). 

I can now develop web applications, using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend and Next.js for fullstack**.

I am excited to start a new  career as a frontend or fullstack web developer! 💯

You can find my web development portfolio in the Repositories tab.
